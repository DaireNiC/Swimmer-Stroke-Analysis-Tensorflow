# Object Tracking Project

This is the README for the Object Tracking project. The program enables the user to track swimmers and storing stroke counts.


## Description

The purpose of this project is to explore the use of Google's Tensorflow machine learning framework, as well as OpenCV, to combine machine learning and image recognition in order to explore its use in real world applications. The proposed project is to track swimmers by either sending in a video file or live feed to the program, which then recognizes swimmers based on a dataset, and track the swimmers movements and number of strokes taken per lap.
